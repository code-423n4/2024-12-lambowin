**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA)) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

## Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues

The 4naly3er report can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-11-lambowin/blob/main/4naly3er-report.md).

_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

1. Rebalance Contract ignore gas cost
The RebalanceOnUniswap contract is designed to maintain the VETH/WETH pool ratio at 1:1 rather than for profit. Gas costs are intentionally omitted to increase rebalancing frequency, accepting gas losses as a trade-off for improved price stability.

2. repayLoan function not used
The repayLoan function in the VirtualToken contract is currently not used. This function is designed to allow valid factories to repay loans by decreasing the debt of a user and 1. burning the corresponding amount of tokens.

We hope to provide services for subsequent liquidity additions. If the withdrawable feature of virtual liquidity can be realized, it will be able to solve the impermanent loss problem of Uniswap V2. We plan to release LamboFactory V2 and conduct audit again.

# Additional context

## Main invariants

The the owner of VETH is invariants.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
1.  The V3 Liquidity (VETH <-> WETH)'s safety
2. The ETH locked in VETH's safety
3. The complicated scenario with unsiwapV2, V3 and VETH's take loan

## All trusted roles in the protocol

## Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts:

Virtual liquidity is a conditional ERC20 token. For each holder address of virtual liquidity, the transferable balance must satisfy the following formula to ensure that the issued virtual liquidity does not enter the market.
